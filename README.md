# etch-a-sketch
The program simulates an etch-a-sketch program! 
A default canvas size of 16x16 px or 16x16 squares is automatically set. You can 
change the canvas size or clear the canvas by setting your preferred dimension. 

Note: The maximum dimension of the canvas is 200x200 px. Any input beyond that
will set the canvas to 200x200 px.
